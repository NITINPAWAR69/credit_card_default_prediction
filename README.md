# credit_card_default_prediction
## description

###This project is aimed at predicting the case of customers default payments in Taiwan. From the perspective of risk management, the result of predictive accuracy of the estimated probability of default will be more valuable than the binary result of classification - credible or not credible clients. We can use the K-S chart to evaluate which customers will default on their credit card paymentsÂ¶

Breakdown of Our Features:

We have records of 30000 customers. Below are the description of all features we have.

ID: ID of each client

LIMIT_BAL: Amount of given credit in NT dollars (includes individual and family/supplementary credit)

SEX: Gender (1 = male, 2 = female)

EDUCATION: (1 = graduate school, 2 = university, 3 = high school, 0,4,5,6 = others)

MARRIAGE: Marital status (0 = others, 1 = married, 2 = single, 3 = others)

AGE: Age in years

Scale for PAY_0 to PAY_6 :

(-2 = No consumption, -1 = paid in full, 0 = use of revolving credit (paid minimum only), 1 = payment delay for one month, 2 = payment delay for two months, ... 8 = payment delay for eight months, 9 = payment delay for nine months and above)

PAY_0: Repayment status in September, 2005 (scale same as above)

PAY_2: Repayment status in August, 2005 (scale same as above)

PAY_3: Repayment status in July, 2005 (scale same as above)

PAY_4: Repayment status in June, 2005 (scale same as above)

PAY_5: Repayment status in May, 2005 (scale same as above)

PAY_6: Repayment status in April, 2005 (scale same as above)

BILL_AMT1: Amount of bill statement in September, 2005 (NT dollar)

BILL_AMT2: Amount of bill statement in August, 2005 (NT dollar)

BILL_AMT3: Amount of bill statement in July, 2005 (NT dollar)

BILL_AMT4: Amount of bill statement in June, 2005 (NT dollar)

BILL_AMT5: Amount of bill statement in May, 2005 (NT dollar)

BILL_AMT6: Amount of bill statement in April, 2005 (NT dollar)

PAY_AMT1: Amount of previous payment in September, 2005 (NT dollar)

PAY_AMT2: Amount of previous payment in August, 2005 (NT dollar)

PAY_AMT3: Amount of previous payment in July, 2005 (NT dollar)

PAY_AMT4: Amount of previous payment in June, 2005 (NT dollar)

PAY_AMT5: Amount of previous payment in May, 2005 (NT dollar)

PAY_AMT6: Amount of previous payment in April, 2005 (NT dollar)

default.payment.next.month: Default payment (1=yes, 0=no)
